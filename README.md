# oopATM
Group 8 final project for Object-Oriented Programming Class @ Rutgers University 

[Brief Summary]

Our group has created a basic ATM system. Users will be able to access a bank account by inputting their account number and pin. Once accessed, the system allows users to view their account balance with additional options navigating them towards deposit and withdraw pages. Accounts and changes made towards the balance are saved upon the termination of the program,saving the information for the next time users log in. Account information will be saved to a text file, which is only modified in a private class for the sake of privacy for the user. 

[Features]

The ATM system allows users to:
  1)Access bank account with proper account number and pin
  2)Check account balance
  3)Deposit
  4)Withdraw
  5)Save changes made upon termination of the program. 

[Instruction Notes]

Change file path of text file to match it on users system 
In addition, use the account names in importing.txt to access the ATM
